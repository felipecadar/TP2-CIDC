   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the training script**:
   Execute the training script to start the training process:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

## Usage

- Modify the `train.py` script to adjust the training parameters, dataset paths, and model configurations as needed.
- Ensure that the necessary datasets are available in the specified locations before running the training script.

## Docker

To build and run the Docker container for the ML training application, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```
   docker build -t ml-training .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
